# Rengoku 
**Set your bookmarks ablaze**

## Inspiration

**Rengoku** is a self-hosted, feature-packed yet lightweight bookmark manager. I am a budding [digital gardener](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). I have a private Git repository called `brain` with about 110 markdown files. It contains all sorts of information, stories, ideas, posts, projects, lists etc. I think about. One such list are categorized websites that I want to preserve for eternity. Maybe it's a very productive discussion on a forum or a [classic story](https://www.ibiblio.org/harris/500milemail.html) that makes me appreciate the whole domain of technology. I find myself hoarding a lot of links.

In doing all this, I found existing solutions very limiting. [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/) felt closest to being the best solution. But still the ergonomics pained me. Also, I cannot pay for the premium at the moment. Sure, I had browser bookmarks. But I don't want to use the same browser across all my devices. Why do none of them have advanced features like tagging based on URL?

Hence, I built RenGoku with 3 principles: **ergonomics**, **power** and **ownership**.
